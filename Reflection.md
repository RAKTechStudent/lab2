# My Reflection / Blog
In my blog, I will be showing people how to use Github. This video will show people the importance of forking and sending pull requests. Here, I added a course description for IST 402. I show in my video, step by step how to do this to the ist402 file. However, I am hoping that after watching my video, they will be able to do it to any file on Github. Overall, I think that this process is easy and efficient. It is a good idea and in my opinion necessary for software developers to communicate and make these changes.
